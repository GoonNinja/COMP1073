    // 4. Get the Google Maps short URL from the string, using the character index number of the comma (use above var, commaLocation), and store it as a variable, called googleUrl
    //since the URL starts at the second character after the comma and ends 4 characters before the end of the string we can use the substring method like so:
    var googleUrl = input.substring(commaLocation + 2, input.length - 4);
    // 5. Build a new string that is an HTML hyperlink, using the Google Maps URL (googleUrl) as the href, the airport code (airportCode), a dash (-), the airport name (airportName), and set it as the value of the result variable (var result = ...) (hint - use concatenation to build out each part of the HTML anchor element, taking care to use the right quotes)
